A project that uses overrides the Django authentication function to track
failed login attempts on a per-user basis.  Code is based on BruteBuster
(http://code.google.com/p/django-brutebuster/) but is simplified because of
the dropped requirement of tracking IP addresses.  Django-Axes is another
source of inspiration (http://code.google.com/p/django-axes/).

Installation
  1. Add failedloginblocker to your INSTALLED_APPS list in settings.py
  2. Add failedloginblocker.middleware.FailedLoginBlockerMiddleware to
    MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES in settings.py
  3. Run 'python manage.py syncdb'

Settings (set in settings.py if you want to override the defaults)
  FLB_MAX_FAILURES - Number of failures to allow before blocking logins.
      Default is set to 5.
  FLB_BLOCK_INTERVAL - The interval from the last failed attempt to determine 
      whether the current login attempt is to count as a failure.
